# Picture-to-Sketch 🖼

In this project I developed a Python model which converts any picture to the pencil sketch irrespective of the lighting factor.

## Installation ⏬

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install cv2.

```bash
pip install opencv-python
```

## Usage ✔
Make sure to replace the below code snippets as suitable .👇
```python
import cv2

# add the location of the image
img_location = 'C:/Users/Users/Admin/Images/' // this is an example

# add name of the image
imgname = 'image.jpg' // example name

```
